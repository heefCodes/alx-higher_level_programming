0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

Description of each file:
0. Write a function that prints all integers of a list.
    Prototype: def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):
1. Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
    Prototype: def element_at(my_list, idx):
2. Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific    position (like in C).
3. Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
    Prototype: def print_reversed_list_integer(my_list=[]):
4. Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific    position without modifying the original list (like in C).
    Prototype: def new_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
5. Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.
    Prototype: def no_c(my_string):
6. Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.
    Prototype: def print_matrix_integer(matrix=[[]]):
7. Write a function that adds 2 tuples.
    Prototype: def add_tuple(tuple_a=(), tuple_b=()):
8. Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
    Prototype: def multiple_returns(sentence):
9. Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
    Prototype: def max_integer(my_list=[]):
10. Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
    Prototype: def max_integer(my_list=[]):
11. Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
    Prototype: def delete_at(my_list=[], idx=0):
12. Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b
    You can find the source code here
    Your code should be inserted where the comment is (line 4)
    Your program should be exactly 5 lines long
13. Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a  palindrome.
    Prototype: int is_palindrome(listint_t **head);
    Return: 0 if it is not a palindrome, 1 if it is a palindrome
    An empty list is considered a palindrome
14. CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming     language. Written in C, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the language.
        Since we now know a bit of C, we can look at what is happening under the hood of Python. Let’s have fun with Python and C, and let’s look at what makes Python so easy to use.
